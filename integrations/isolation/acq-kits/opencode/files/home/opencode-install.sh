# opencode-install.sh — install the pinned OpenCode CLI binary into the sandbox.
#
# Runs at CREATE time as ROOT (install phase). Detects the guest architecture,
# fetches the matching pinned OpenCode v2 platform tarball from npm's registry,
# verifies its sha256, extracts the single `opencode` binary, and installs it
# on PATH for every user. FAIL-CLOSED on integrity, FAIL-SOFT on availability:
# any download/network/extraction failure degrades to "opencode absent, agent
# unavailable this boot" (never a dead sandbox, matching the kit-library
# convention — see openchamber-start.sh and pi-coding-agent-install.sh), but a
# SHA-256 MISMATCH refuses to install the mismatched bytes and does NOT fall
# back to any other install path. There is no unpinned fallback for this kit
# to fall back to — see docs/decisions/fail-closed-on-integrity.md for why that
# matters here specifically, unlike the optional-capability kits in this
# family.
#
# WHY create-time (install phase): OpenCode v2's CLI wrapper package
# (@opencode/cli) uses a postinstall script to select and copy an optional
# architecture-specific binary package. To keep installation deterministic and
# non-interactive, this kit skips that lifecycle script entirely and downloads
# the pinned platform package tarball directly from npm. The tarball already
# contains the real binary, so the create-time install is still plain
# curl+verify+extract with no native build or toolchain.
#
# ARCHITECTURE: microVM/container guests are aarch64 on Apple Silicon hosts and
# x86-64 on amd64 hosts (same lesson as the goose-server and mcp-gateway kits).
# Installing a fixed x64 binary on an aarch64 guest fails at runtime with "Exec
# format error", so we SELECT the package by `uname -m`. OpenCode v2's Linux
# platform packages are named `@opencode/cli-linux-<arch>` where <arch> is x64
# or arm64, with a baseline x64 package for hosts without AVX2.
#
# INTEGRITY: npm package tarballs are immutable artifacts for a published
# version, so we pin each ARCHIVE's sha256 directly and verify before
# extracting. Pins arrive via the environment ONLY — this script has NO literal
# fallback values (unlike pi-coding-agent-install.sh's
# ${PI_CODING_AGENT_VERSION:-0.84.3} pattern): the kit's spec.yaml install
# command is the single source of truth for these values, and an unset
# value fails soft to "agent absent" below rather than installing anything
# unpinned. A literal fallback here would be a second copy of the pin that
# could silently drift from spec.yaml's — deliberately not duplicated.
#   OPENCODE_VERSION                    — npm package version, e.g. 2.0.22 (NOT "latest")
#   OPENCODE_SHA256_LINUX_X64            — sha256 of cli-linux-x64-<version>.tgz
#   OPENCODE_SHA256_LINUX_X64_BASELINE   — sha256 of cli-linux-x64-baseline-<version>.tgz
#   OPENCODE_SHA256_LINUX_ARM64          — sha256 of cli-linux-arm64-<version>.tgz
# To bump: change the version + hashes in spec.yaml's install command,
# re-verify against the real npm tarballs (download + `shasum -a 256`, not
# copied from any third party).
#
# WHY WE DO NOT USE THE opencode.ai/install SCRIPT: that script resolves
# "latest" by default (an explicit --version flag is required to pin at all),
# downloads via a redirect chain this script instead resolves and allow-lists
# explicitly, and is designed for interactive/CI use, not a non-interactive,
# SHA-pinned create-time install. For v2, we fetch the same underlying platform
# package tarball that @opencode/cli's postinstall would select, with our own
# pin and verification.
